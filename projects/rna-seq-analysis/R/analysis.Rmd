## Introduction
This analysis explores how RmpA regulates the switch between hypermucoviscosity and biofilm formation in bacteria. The dataset (GSE286114) includes both E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, providing insights into:
- Transcriptional changes in RmpA mutants
- Metabolic pathway regulation
- Biofilm formation mechanisms
- Virulence factor expression

## Experimental Design
- Organisms: E. coli and K. pneumoniae
- Conditions: Wild-type vs RmpA mutants
- Technology: RNA-seq (Illumina HiSeq 4000)
